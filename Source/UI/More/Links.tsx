### Collaborative debating 

Hopefully, of course, you'll find this site the best option for debate-mapping -- and that through feedback we can resolve its remaining deficiencies.${""
	} For those wanting to see other options, however, the below is a listing of the best alternatives we're aware of.

Criteria:
* Layout format: how efficiently you can parse arguments and premises from the presented data.
* Contribution efficiency: how easy it is to create and edit content.
* Features: how substantial the features provided are.
* Momentum: how large/healthy the community is, and how much the project continues to be improved/developed.
* Open source: whether the source code is provided. (which allows for wider usage, and community-based improvement)

The scores indicate how well each site does on the given factor, relative to the others.

### Others

The websites below don't really match the "collaborative debating" concept, but still relate in some way and may be found useful:
* [ProCon](http://www.procon.org): Presents various arguments on topics in a clear and impartial way, but does not allow improvement by users.
* [DebateWise](http://debatewise.org): About the same as the above, except with voting on the article and comments, but slightly lower quality.
* [Snopes](http://www.snopes.com): Fact-checking website, on a wide range of topics.
* [PolitiFact](http://www.politifact.com): Fact-checking website, focused mainly on politics.
* [FactCheck](http://factcheck.org): Yes, also a fact-checking website. Does not seem as full-fledged as the previous two.
